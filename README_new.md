## About the Project

**Features**
- üìù **Textual Editor** to specify ER model elements with *rich-text editing support*, such as syntax highlighting, code completion or validation.
- üìä **Diagram Editor** that is synchronized with the textual editor and automatically updated. Includes a toolbar to  interact with the underlying model and customize the diagram.
- üñ®Ô∏è **Code Generator** to generate SQL tables from the specified ER model.  

The tool uses a language server for the ER modeling language which communicates its language features through the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). This makes bigER highly reusable, increases perfomance and simplifies implementation for other editors that also use the LSP. 

The language and editor features are realized with the [Xtext](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) language workbench, while [Sprotty](https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty) with a [Sprotty-enhanced Graphical Language Server](https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty-server) is used for rendering the diagrams. All of this is integrated with VS Code by implementing a [Sprotty VS Code Extension](https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty-vscode).
